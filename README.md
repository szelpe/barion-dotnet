# Barion .NET

The Barion .NET library makes it easy to add Barion payment to your .NET application. It is built upon [Barion's Web API](https://doksi.barion.com/).

- Newtonsoft.Json

## Release Notes

[Release Notes](https://github.com/szelpe/barion-dotnet/blob/master/ReleaseNotes.md)

## Installation

The easiest way to install is to use NuGet:

```
Install-Package BarionClient
```

## Usage

The heart of the library is the `BarionClient` class which provides the `ExecuteAsync` method to execute various operations.
Create the operation class you want to use: `StartPaymentOperation`, `GetPaymentStateOperation`, `RefundOperation` or `FinishReservationOperation` respectively.
After setting the operation properties you can use the `ExecuteAsync` method and pass the opertaion as the parameter.

> Note that `BarionClient` implements `IDisposable`, use it [accordingly](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/yh598w02.aspx).

[QuickStart guide](https://github.com/szelpe/barion-dotnet/blob/master/QuickStart.md)

### Example

``` csharp
var barionSettings = new BarionSettings
    {
        BaseUrl = new Uri("https://api.test.barion.com/"),
        POSKey = Guid.Parse("d1bcff3989885d3a98235c1cd768eba2")
    };

using(var barionClient = new BarionClient(barionSettings))
{
	var startPayment = new StartPaymentOperation();

	// add payment parameters to startPayment

	var result = await barionClient.ExecuteAsync<StartPaymentOperationResult>(startPayment);

	if(result.IsOperationSuccessful)
	{
		// redirect the user to the payment page
	}
}
```

#### Registering as a service in ASP.NET Core

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
	var barionSettings = new BarionSettings
	{
		BaseUrl = new Uri("https://api.test.barion.com/"),
		POSKey = Guid.Parse("d1bcff3989885d3a98235c1cd768eba2"),
		Payee = "test@example.com",
	};

	services.AddSingleton(barionSettings);
	services.AddTransient<BarionClient>();
	services.AddHttpClient<BarionClient>();
	// ...
}
```

The lifetime of the service is controlled by the framework this way so you don't have to manually dispose the object (i.e. you don't have to use the `using` statement).

## Sample website

You can find a complete sample website under the `Samples` directory. Check [BarionController](https://github.com/szelpe/barion-dotnet/blob/master/Samples/SampleWebsite/Controllers/BarionController.cs) for a detailed example on how to use the client.

## Retry Policies

BarionClient comes with built-in retry policies. By default, if a Barion operation fails due to a transient error, it will retry the operation automatically.

You can choose the retry policy to use from the list below:

- **Exponential retry (default)**: the delay between each retry grows exponentially, e.g. `~3s -> ~7s -> ~15s -> ~31s`. The exponential retry policy is well suited for background operations, which are not time sensitive.
- **Linear retry**: the delay between each retry is fixed, e.g. `0.5s -> 0.5s -> 0.5s`. The linear retry policy should be used in user interactive operations. If a user is waiting for the result, it's usually better to fail fast than letting the user wait for minutes.
- **No retry**: will not retry the failed operations. This option should be used if a retry strategy is implemented on a higher level.

``` csharp
barionClient.RetryPolicy = new LinearRetry(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500), 3);
```

## Timeout

The default timeout for every operation is 120s. You can change the timeout by settings the `Timeout` property of the `BarionClient`:

``` csharp
barionClient.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(15);
```

You can disable the timeout by using `InfiniteTimeSpan`:

``` csharp
barionClient.Timeout = System.Threading.Timeout.InfiniteTimeSpan;
```

## Extending the API

You can easily add your own operations by creating a new subclass of `BarionOperation`. E.g. if you want to support the [Reject](https://doksi.barion.com/Payment-Reject-v2) payment operation you need to create a new class:

``` csharp
public class RejectOperation : BarionOperation
{
    public override HttpMethod Method => HttpMethod.Post;
    public override Uri RelativeUri => new Uri("/v2/Payment/Reject", UriKind.Relative);
    public override Type ResultType => typeof(RejectOperationResult);

    public string UserName { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; }
    public Guid PaymentId { get; set; }
}
```

And the class which represents the result of the operation:

``` csharp
public class RejectOperationResult : BarionOperationResult
{
    public Guid PaymentId { get; set; }
    public bool IsSuccess { get; set; }
}
```

After this you can use your own operation class the same way as the built in ones.
